# postgraduate-D66
It's finally Friday today. I really feel like days are like years here. Anyway, I have a feeling that there are too many things to learn. Today, Java only learned IO stream, and there are still heavy contents behind. Why is this industry so hard? I feel that I just want to take a break when I get home, otherwise I really can't stand high-intensity learning, I feel that I will always forget some things. I feel that my mental state has been in a tight state. My spirit is always highly concentrated. It is really very painful. But the weekend is coming soon. I can finally have a good rest. Hey, I'm so tired
